I decided for this project to manually tune the parameters. I proceeded like this:

1- Set all the weights to zero
2- Increase P until the time it took the car to converge towards cte=0 was satisfying. At this point the car oscillates a lot around the ideal position
3- Increase D until the oscillations are under control
4- Increase I to reduce the cte when the car is stable.

I naturally had to repeat these steps a number of times in order to get an acceptable result.
All the tuning was done by moving the car to the side of the road in manual mode before starting the controller. This way I kind of simulated a step response for the system.
